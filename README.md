<ul>
<li>This project is designed to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on a number of risk factors. The goal of the project is to help identify individuals who are at high risk for developing the disease so that preventive measures can be taken early on to minimize the likelihood¬†of¬†complication </li>

</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the body's ability to produce or use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood and is caused by the immune system attacking the cells that produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in adulthood and is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.

The effects of diabetes can be serious and long-lasting. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels, nerves, and organs, leading to a range of health complications.

  </li>
  </ul>

</picture> Proposed Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> Machine learning can be used to develop predictive models that can analyze health-related data and identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes. These models can use a wide range of data such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and other health-related features to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes.

The effects of predicting diabetes using ML are numerous and significant. Firstly, it can help healthcare professionals to identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes at an early stage. This allows for early intervention and preventive measures, such as lifestyle changes and medication, to be put in place to manage the disease and reduce its complications.

Secondly, predicting diabetes using ML can help to reduce the burden of the disease on healthcare systems and the wider society. Early detection and prevention can reduce the number of individuals who require medical intervention for complications arising from diabetes, reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of life of individuals with diabetes.

Finally, ML-based diabetes prediction models can also be used to gain insights into the underlying causes of diabetes and how to prevent it. These models can identify the most important factors that contribute to the risk of diabetes, helping healthcare professionals to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

In summary, predicting diabetes using ML is crucial for early detection and prevention of the disease. It can help to reduce the burden of the disease on healthcare systems and the wider society and provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of diabetes.

</picture> Value for society :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> The use of a prediction model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes using Intel OneAPI can have significant value for society. 
The benefits of early intervention in diabetes are significant. It can reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and amputations, which can have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals and their families. Additionally, early intervention can lead to cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for expensive treatments and hospitalizations.

By leveraging Intel OneAPI to develop a diabetes prediction model, healthcare professionals can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, making it a valuable tool for society as a whole </ul>

<ul>
<li>In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.
<li>For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.</li>
<li>For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.</li>
<li>These all are to improve the Agriculture, that‚Äôs slightly reduces the poverty, climatic condition, soil erosion etc ...</li></ul><br></div><br>
